I have\n        built out a fully functional webpage that is coded in github and public\n        on the web. I also plan to continue to build this site as I learn more\n        and build more projects.\n      </p>\n      <hr style={styles.horizontalLine} /> {/* Added another horizontal line */}\n      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>\n        Continuation of Our Carbon Calculator Journey\n      </h2>\n      <p style={styles.date}>Jan 8, 2:44 PM - Blog #3</p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        Welcome back to Blog #3! Lots of stuff has happened in the past few\n        weeks so let's get right into it.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        When I wrote my last entry it was Christmas Eve and Joe and I just\n        finished a 12-hour coding day where we started to build our first basic\n        program in Wix Velo code. After that, I began to reach out to developers\n        for help as I realized there was too much to learn and we needed some\n        guidance and help to build our first version of the calculator. Below is\n        a picture of the message I sent out to our developers.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        After I sent this I got a response very quickly from the S9 Consulting\n        Developers and we hopped on a call on Dec 26th. I was impressed with\n        their response time and commitment to work over the holidays. It became\n        apparent very quickly that they would be the first developers we hired\n        to help with our MVP.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        In the call, S9 and I discussed what our vision for Forevergreen.earth\n        was and what we could do with the $500 budget. We agreed that the Dev\n        team would fully integrate our current version of the calculator into\n        Wix Velo and add a login system for users to sign in and adjust their\n        data. They sent over the statement of work that day and we got to\n        building.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        I also spent a lot of time building out easy-to-follow blogs and\n        documentation of our current version and what we were going for. I\n        published these on our test site as well as the Forevergreen site. Below\n        are the links to each blog if you want to check them out.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        We look to sustainable business strategy to guide our decision-making.\n        Operating an ethical business requires minimizing impacts on the planet,\n        future generations, and society. Many investors now will use ESG metrics\n        to evaluate companies as these considerations are valuable to understand\n        a company's longevity. In this paper, I will review three different\n        examples that have inspired me through their ethical and sustainable\n        business practices. We explore environmental impact and ethical sourcing\n        at Diamond Tropical Hardwoods, social impact and diversity initiatives\n        at BNP Paribas, and corporate social responsibility at Dicks Sporting\n        Goods and how their strategy does a fantastic job at creating shared\n        value and impacting their communities while producing profits.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        I am interested to see if these proved to be helpful for the team.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        Since I handed off the actual development to the infinitely more skilled\n        Wix Velo Devs, I have recently had some more time to continue on my\n        Replit 100 Days of Code. I have been learning a ton about Python and\n        even some HTML (which is how I made this blog). If you follow me on\n        Twitter you will see I post the code for every lesson along with some\n        other cool stuff every once in a while.\n      </p>\n      {/* Note: Twitter embed won't work directly in React.

After that, my current plan is to\n        spend 2 weeks studying that code and improving little things here and\n        there so that on Feb 1 we can have a product that provides a cool\n        service for our users and can collect revenues.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        Thank you for following along with my blog!\n      </p>\n      <hr style={styles.horizontalLine} />\n      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>\n        Progress Update on the Carbon Calculator\n      </h2>\n      <p style={styles.date}>Dec 24, 8:29 PM - Blog #2</p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        Hello!

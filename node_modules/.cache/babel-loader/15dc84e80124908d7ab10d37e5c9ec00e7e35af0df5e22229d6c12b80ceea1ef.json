Welcome to my blog! Super pumped you are reading this and\n        hopefully it can help others learn from my process. My goal for this\n        blog is to document my process of building my first product and a real\n        piece of code. I want to learn along with the progression of this blog\n        to see where I learned, failed, and improved to hopefully maximize my\n        growth.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This first post is exciting as I have no lines of code written! There is\n        much to be done and I am very excited to learn. I have some experience\n        in Java as I learned it last year through an online course and course at\n        Pitt. I am confident I can build my product here and implement it into\n        WIX.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        So where am I in the process?
